    <h4 style = "clear:both;">Binary Search Tree<br/>(UC San Diego Project Assignment)</h4>
    <div id = "leftSide" >
      Description: Implement a Binary Search Tree that can has an insert function, find function, and a printTree function.
      <br/><br/>To complete this project I had two classes:(class BST and class Node)<br /><br />		
      The BST class: This class would have a root pointer that would point to the root node.<br/>
      Also this class would have a counter for the number of Nodes created.<br /><br />

      The Node Class: This class would hold the given key and several pointers.
      Every node would contain an integer variable value.<br/>
      Every node would have a parent pointer, a leftChild pointer, and a rightChild pointer.<br/><br/>

  We would receive a vector of integers and then construct the BST using all the elements in the vector.<br/>  
  <br/> Run time for inserting and finding an element:<br/> 
  Average case scenario:  O(log n)<br/> 
  Best case scenario: O(1)<br/> 
  Worst Case scenario: O(n)<br/>

    <h4 style = "clear:both;">Multi-way Trie<br/>(UC San Diego Project Assignment)</h4>
    <div id = "leftSide" >
    Description: Use a Multi-way Trie to efficiently store a large amount of words.<br/>
    <br/> Run time for inserting and finding an word:<br/> 
    Worst Case scenario: O(s), where s is the word with the longest length.<br/> 
    <br/>This data stucture allows us to not depend on the number of words inserted,
    which is perfect because if we enter a large amount of words, 
    then it won't affect the run time for inserting or finding a word.<br/><br/>
    
    We also, count the frequency of the words to implement a word autocompletion feature.<br/><br/>

    To complete this project I had two classes:<br/>(class MultiwayTrie and class Node)<br/><br />
    

    The Multiway Trie class:<br/> 
    This class contained a root node pointer and also a counter for the number of nodes created.<br /> 
    This class contained the following functions: insert a word function, find a word function, and delete word function.
    <br/><br/>
    

    The Node class:<br/>
    Every node would hold an array of 27 NULL pointers.<br />
    If we have an index that point to some other node then that would mean that a character is being used.

    <br/><br />We read a file with many words, we would read the words character by character,
    <br />we would simulate the entire word using the array and the index pointers inside the node.

    <br /><br/>To finish the project and implement the autocomplete feature, <br/>
    we would go to the given prefix and then use the Depth-First Search algorithm,
    <br/>to find all the words after the given prefix.<br/><br/>We will then print all the words found after the prefix 
    and that is how I completed the autocompletion feature.<br/>

    <h4 style = "clear:both;">File Compression and Decompression using a Huffman Tree<br/>(UC San Diego Project Assignment)</h4>
    <div id = "leftSide" >
    Description: Use a Huffman tree to compress data efficiently into a file and then decompress the file without any data loss.<br/><br/>
    
    To complete this project I would need two classes: <br/>(class HuffmanTree and class Node) <br/><br />
    The HuffmanTree class:<br />
    This class will had a vector of 256 pointers(One pointer for each character that can be found in the ASCII table): 
    We would have a pointer point to a node, if we see the given character in the given file.
    <br/>This class would also hold a counter for the number of nodes created.<br/><br/>
    For functions: buildTree function, the parameter of this function would be a vector with the frequency count of every character. 
    This build function would build our huffmanTree.<br/><br/>

    
    The Node class:<br />Every node would contain the character symbol and also the count frequency.
    Also it would have three pointers, one for the parent, one for the left child , and one for the right child.

    
  <br/><br/>To compress a file: We would read a file character by character, and then count the frequency for each character. 
    According to the frequencies, we would then build our Huffman Tree.
  <br/><br />The Huffman tree would allow us to encode the most frequent character with the least amount of data encoding, while the less frequent character would have larger encoding.
  We would encode the entire file and in the end we would have a compressed file that has a
  smaller data size than our original file.
  <br/><br/>
  The decompress file: 
  Rebuild the same Huffman tree by using the frequency data from the compressed file.<br/>
  Take the encoded message and decode it using the Huffman tree. The end result would be the original file.

    <h4 style = "clear:both;">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon<br/>(UC San Diego Project Assignment)</h4>
    <div id = "leftSide" >
    Description: Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a parlor game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept,<br/>which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.<br/><br/> 
    The goal is to find the Bacon Number, which is the separation number between Kevin Bacon and another hollywood star.<br/><br/> 
    To complete this project I had two classes: (class Graph and class Node)<br/><br/>
    The Node class: Every Node would have the name of the actor and a set of pairs: pair(year,movie)
    <br />Also every node would have have an adjacency vector, it would create imaginary edges to the other nodes if there exists a relationship.
    <br/><br/>The Graph class: The graph would contain a node counter.
    <br />I implemeted a makeEdges function, this function would take in the entire graph and create the imaginary edges. 
    <br />To find the bacon number, I would run the Breadth First Search algorithm, to find the shortest paths between Kevin Bacon and the other hollywood actor.
    <br />The number of traversed nodes using this shortest path would be the Keving Bacon number for given hollywood actor.
